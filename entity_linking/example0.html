        "review": "Excellent Wall Mount Kit For Large Heavy TV. I used this stand to wall mount an old 52\" Sony Bravia KDL52XBR4. The TV without its stand weighs 95 pounds. This wall mount is perfect for the TV, it is stable and solid when attached to studs with the included lag bolts. I don't require any sideways tilt, just a slight downward tilt. Being able to extend the stand from the wall made it very easy to attach power, HDMI and audio cables after hanging the TV on the stand. The level adjustments on the brackets attached to the TV made it easy to get the TV perfectly level.\n\nThe only small negative I ran into was that despite the wide variety of included spacers and hardware, the particular recess diameter, recess depth and thread depth into the TV body led me to purchase an inexpensive M6 hardware kit with appropriate washer diameter and screw length.\n\nIn all, I couldn't be much happier with this wall mount kit. The TV is securely mounted and stable. The installation went smoothly, first pass success with no problems of any kind.",

        "review": "As expected. I purchased this nest camera battery to replace another battery brand camera on the side of my house. I went into this knowing the new nest cam wouldn\u2019t work with the Nest app and would have to use Google Home app to view it but having all cameras under one app is the end goal for myself. \n\nThe camera itself so far seems to be great. I\u2019m already subscribed to the nest subscription so it\u2019s great not needing onboard storage and everything is uploaded to the cloud. My nest cam is roughly 9\u2019 above ground whereas google recommends approx 6.5\u2019 but it\u2019s had no issues picking up people in the zone I\u2019ve created. \n\nSo far the battery has dropped 3% in just 24 hours but I blame the excessive motion it picked up yesterday. I found adding a zone for alerts only and setting the motion sensitivity to medium works best. I\u2019m also using full resolution video so that will also deplete battery faster. I can see Google claims of battery life being accurate - pretty standard amongst other battery operated cameras, possibly a bit worse but this camera has much more onboard intelligence whereas my legacy nest cameras use the cloud for their processing. The big winner here will be when Google Nest releases their solar panel so it doesn\u2019t need to be recharged every couple of months. \n\nThe deduction of the star is simply due to Google\u2019s inability to create at least one app that does everything. The Google Home app allows you to scrub events (battery) in the app or scrub video 24/7 if your battery cam is connected to a power source. Have an existing Nest doorbell or other older Nest cameras? Can\u2019t scrub video - you\u2019ll need to go back to the Nest app to do this on your other cameras where you\u2019ll not find your new Nest Cam battery because it\u2019s only in the home app!\n\nI\u2019m sure (not really) google will introduce all these functions into the Home app, but why not now? Makes zero sense to me. \n\nHere are photos comparing the two cameras. The Nest cam has the much larger FOV.",

        "review": "Good unit, but form factor is a double-edged sword. A power outage a few weeks ago while working from home demonstrated the Achilles heel of my home infrastructure--while my laptop (which already HAS a battery) and monitors work of a UPS, my network, ie modem & router did NOT--meaning files I was working on and doing setup on a web app got abruptly disrupted. While waiting for the power to return, I ran to Best Buy and picked up this unit to mitigate future occurrences. \n\nAs I believe other reviewers observed, it offers plenty of outlets, but using more than two of them can be a challenge if they are the kind of bricky plugs that many networking devices use--luckily I was able to cram two of them in (see pic). Would have been nice if they had designed it to be a little more accommodating in this respect, maybe even just rotating the outlets 90 degrees. Hence I docked it a star.\n\nOn the plus side, for its capability--probably 4 hours or more of uninterrupted power to my network--it has a relatively small form factor, so it resides relatively unnoticed on a bookshelf. Also, the readouts are pretty cool & informative. Also like the fact that you can silence it when in use, a feature my computer one doesn't have. I may pick up a couple more of these as time & money allows to replace my computer one and perhaps one for the TV so we can stream movies throughout a blackout!\n\nNote, prevailing good fortune since getting this has prevented me from really putting it to the test (ie, seeing if it maintains in an actual outage), but at least I can work with some amount of confidence that I'm protected.",

I use this one for my 65\u201d Samsung (with a center-based stand, legs would be off the top).  It can support a whopping 250 lbs, far more than any tv you would buy today.  I highly recommend it.

        "review": "I'd give it a rating of six if I could.... I have been thru a few cameras. The D7200, the D7500, the D750. And the Sony RX10 IV. None of them compare to this beast. Many think it's a cropped sensor camera so it can't be that good. Trust me that it's \"that good\". I'll expand...\n\nFirst and foremost, it's a pro-body camera. It has features that the others do not. It feels much better in the hand. The rear LCD display can be pivoted up or down so that you can have more flexibility while shooting, unlike the others which only go one way. It shoots ten frames per second unlike the others which are about half that or less. That's a game changer when you're shooting wildlife, sports, or anything like an air show that requires speed. This body just feels powerful compared to the others.\n\nAnother thing that I read in other reviews before buying it, and that I definitely noticed once I loaded a few images onto the computer for editing...was how accurate the colors are. That was not the case with the other camera bodies. Very impressed.\n\nI bought the 35mm f1.8 Nikon fixed lens w/ this camera body, as they say that's a must at a price of $199. The sample images below were taken with that lens. I will also be adding the Tamron 16-300mm for Nikon bodies @ $629. Both the lens and this camera body are moisture and dust sealed, making them a perfect combo for a long hike.\n\nIf I could add that \"Asia\" from the Akron Best Buy store was more than helpful. She made the transaction very simple, and had a great attitude. Thank you Best Buy and Nikon. Products like this make life more enjoyable.",

        "review": "Let the Robots Vacuum & Mop Your Floors With Vigor. This is the perfect combination for maintaining a clean floor with basically zero effort! The iRobot Roomba i3+ empties itself into a clean bag in a deep storage bin. Unlike the earlier generation robots, no more digging in a small crevice to extract the dirt is required! The i3+ brilliantly returns to it's dock to recharge; a powerful cyclone fan emanates from the storage silo, and all of the dirt is extracted into the storage bin! If the robot runs out of battery power, or fills up the internal dirt storage, it navigates back to it's base, recharges, empties the dirt, then finishes the vacuuming right where it left off! \n\nI have owned 6 vacuum robots to date, but the i3+ impresses me more than any other. The attractive sweeping lines it leaves on the carpet are perfectly straight. Using the i3+, you get the feeling that this is a polished product, tested for generations & honed to perfection. It is a keeper! \n\nThe Braava jet m6 is equally as impressive as the i3 Vacuum. Again, perfectly straight lines. I like the fact that it is built to use Bona floor cleaning liquid, considered the top-of-the-line. It sprays ahead of motion, just as a Bona mop, then moves back and forth using a genuine Bona mop pad. The results are magnificent! Clean, shiny floor. The pad is machine washable.\n\nThe vacuum & the mop are stand alone; you can locate them on different floors, if you choose. Both create a detailed map of your floor, which enables you to select the target area to be cleaned by simply touching that portion of the map, or direct it to clean everywhere. \n\nCONCLUSION: \n\nI am highly impressed by this combination by iRobot & recommend it without hesitation.",

        "review": "Astro Quality At A Value Price. Let me preface my review by saying I have owned and tried hundreds of various wired and wireless headsets. My prior headset was the Logitech G Pro X which is twice the price of these A10s. This new revision of the A10 is in my opinion better than the original and a steal at it's current selling price. You get a incredibly comfortable headset that sounds great right out of the box and works with every device that has a 3.5mm jack. The microphone comes across super clear from what I've been told. I will say though that this headset while amazing for me isn't going to be for everyone. It's earcups are incredibly comfortable but a little on the smaller side. They sit more on the ear than over the ear like other headsets but that doesn't bother me. Also they may not be large enough for those with a bigger head. I have a smaller head and am currently at the second adjustment mark from the maximum setting. They fit me perfectly but I can see others having a problem. Sound quality is incredible for this price point as I mainly play first person shooters such as Apex Legends and I could pinpoint enemy directions very easily with these. Also was hearing little details in the environment that I wasn't hearing with the G Pros. Honestly like these do much that I have already ordered another pair to have as a backup.",

My wife and I recently purchased a ten year old house and decided to purchased new Samsung appliances including a gas range, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and and new washer and dryer. My wife and I are very happy with our new Samsung electric dryer. I decided to dismantle the unit when it was delivered in order to modify the factory rear vent setup into a side venting unit. I went online and watched a video on how to do it . It was a little tense tearing apart our brand new dryer and then putting it all back together but it wasn't as difficult as I had initially thought that it would be. We did not want the back of our new Samsung dryer and washer to site 6 inches away from the wall. Our's now only sites 1-1/2\" away from the wall giving us more room in front of both units.

        "review": "Amazing for now.. So far I am pleased... I know this is a bad time to be buying a receiver being that we are on the verge of proper HDMI 2.1 receivers coming out. But I needed something to replace my other garbage one I had previously. It was an entry level Onkyo which I purchased on BB as well but it just wouldn't play nice with my newly acquired LG C1 65\". Anyways got tired of trying to make it work properly and went on BB and looked for the best sub 699 receiver that I could get right away. Well this one was the only free overnight one and it just happened to have a lot of the features I was looking for.\n\n~ Arc/eArc works without any fiddling along the LG C1 TV. \n~ 7.2 with the option of running Bi-Amp fronts. Since I am a 3.1 guy this was a nice feature to utilize that amp a little bit more.\n~ Enough inputs for all my devices including proper phone input for the wife record player, something the Onkyo did not have.\n~ Nice calibration even though I changed a lot of the settings after. \n~ And overall clean look receiver.\n\nI have paired it with a pair of Klipsch RP600, a RP600C center and R100SW sub. Sounds short of amazing being that I upgraded from some white van speakers I got some 10 years ago... I did only pay 50 bucks only and they weren't bad just meh. But this receiver gives this speaker a nice lively sound compared to the Onkyo.  It may be just in my brain but once I bi-amped the speakers along with going from the built in preamp to the receiver phono preamp the wife record player just sounds amazing. \n\nAnyways solid receiver. Feature packed and if you in need for a receiver right now and you can't wait then this receiver will work superbly.\n\nWorks perfectly with the LG C1 TV.",

        "review": "Can be a sports lens with the right light.. I bought this initially as a travel walk around lens for days when I needed a wide range of focal length and didn't want too much gear. I was very good for that except not much bokeh when zoomed out all the way.\n\nLast week, I used this as a photo lens at the US Climbing Youth Nationals, mounted on both a Z6ii and Z7ii . I also used the Z 24-120 F4 S lens. The 24-200 gave me the reach I needed without too much sacrifice to IQ compared to the 24-120 S.  As long as I had decent light, I was very happy with the results. For a few backlit situations at full zoom, I did miss the F4 aperture.",

The Even-Heat true convection helps you achieve more consistent baking and roasting.",
        "review": "Beautiful. Incredible aesthetics!  Looks phenomenal.  The power burners don't seem to be intended for everyday cooking; but they've been great for canning. We've only owned it for the summer, so the oven hasn't been used for roasting or heavy baking yet, but it's produced great results with the day-to-day items. \n\nThe Wi-Fi connection (remote start) has been a useful feature on our way home from kids' games. We'll grab a take 'n bake pizza and the oven will be preheated when we get in the door.\n\nTwo things prevent me from giving it a fifth star. The burners turn on top easy. I've bumped them while wiping the backsplash behind the range and a burner will fire up.  It's not a very safe feature. We also wish it had a digital display on it... the Wi-Fi feature (and app) are nice, but shouldn't be the only way to track your baking/cooking.",

        "review": "RING IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY!!!. This company is not trustworthy! I spoke to a representative to inquire about the security cameras that I could have installed under an eave and was told that the Ring Floodlight Cam would work. Therefore, I waited until Black Friday to purchase so that I could take advantage of the great deals that were out at the time. I was able to buy it for $50.00 less with a free echo dot, YAAAY!!! But hold on, we hired a professional electrician to come out and do the install and was informed that it will not be able to be installed underneath an eave as we were told by a Ring Representative. Called back in and spoke to another rep to explain my situation for them to say that no it will not work but the spotlight cam mount would be our best option since our desire was to have it hardwired. Therefore, we had to return for an exchange from Best Buy. Unfortunately, this product cost $50.00 more for less lighting and I had to end up paying for the Alexa dot that was in the package deal at the time of original purchase which now costed me $282.06 for the exchange. After I arrived home, I contacted Ring to explain to them what their Representative costed me by delivering the wrong information and Dillon (Ring Rep) replied that there was nothing that he could do and continued to insinuate that I wanted to be reimbursed or given a free device when I asked for neither. The customer service is very poor in my opinion which left me with a dreadful experience. I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone to this company. Besides, after watching YouTube there are a variety of products on the market that are much better for much less. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why this product has such poor reviews as well as low end customer service.",

        "review": "A Good Choice 7 out of 10. The sculpting and proportions are off and a bit of a weird choice for the ranger figure, if you compare them to some of the others in this this line. On the opposite end of the spectrum the villain figure is very nicely executed. As far as paint it's hit or miss from box to box but if non of that matters, as far as playability for these two figures they're solid. My only issue slash concerns are the interchangeable hands and that they come warped because of how they're packaged.",

The top cleans nicely with Weiman\u2019s glass top cleaner. 2) oven capabilities including regular bake, regular roast, convection bake/roast, and air fry.  I am still learning about the convection and airfry features. You have to make some adjustments with convection (time/temperature). This oven has a hidden heating element, making it easier to clean.

        "review": "Serves its purpose beautifully!!!. This product is very good quality, very quiet, keeps everything SUPER cold, and is just the right size. We got it to replace our old fridge that was LONG overdue for being replaced because it was so old, no longer working properly, super loud, and especially because it did not have a freezer which just doesn't work for someone who LOVES ice cream. Anyways, we use it in our 2 person office here at work and so for the 2 of us, it works out just perfectly. It's just the right proportion of fridge and freezer space. Did I mention...the freezer space?! It's more than enough space to fit the 4 to 6 pints of ice cream that I like to keep on hand at any given time (which I know...as you can see in the pics I am running terribly low), but if I really wanted to, I could easily fit 9 on top and 9 on bottom (that's without the ice tray) just to put the size into perspective for you. That's 18 pints of ice cream and this is called a mini fridge???!!! Btw, I also LOVE the mini, teeny, tiny ice tray that it comes with!!! Little, teeny, tiny ice cubes! Adorable!!! Point being, it's great and serves its purpose beautifully. We would recommend it 100% to anyone considering purchasing or acquiring one. You'll be glad you did if you do. If you do...enjoy!",

        "review": "Chose this over the Dell 2720Q. Solid value!!. For those looking for other reviews online for this monitor (27UP80B-W), just note that this is the retail version of the 27UP850. The main difference is the stand included on this version is not adjustable. \n\nI bought this LG and the Dell 2720Q. Both were very comparable in terms of specs. I was super torn because I liked the build quality (plus the lack of bottom bezel) of the dell better, but the LG was ultimately brighter. I ended up returning the dell and purchasing this monitor again thanks to the sale price. I figured I could buy two of these monitors for just a little over the price of one Dell monitor.\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan of this monitor. I'm using both of them with my Mac Studio and the colors are solid out of the box. It's even better once you calibrate it. I'm loving that it uses USB-C and has PD when I decide to plug my MacBook in it. It's also super bright and has decent contrast for an IPS display.\n\nThe build quality is decent for the price, but I wish it felt as solid as the Dell 2720. The bottom bezel sort of bothered me in the beginning, but I've noticed it less in the weeks I've used it. The stand it comes with is trash. It's not adjustable at all and it's a bit wobbly, but it is VESA mountable and would highly recommend mounting this monitor on a monitor arm. \n\nOne thing to mention if you go with this monitor is to turn off the power saving function inside the OSD. With it in on, it automatically turns the brightness down and it caused me about 10 minutes of frustration in the beginning. Once I turned it off, it was smooth sailing.\n\nFor the quality and features it comes, you can't beat it at this price. Highly recommended.",

        "product_desc": "Fly a compatible camera drone confidently with these DJI Mavic Air 2 and DJI Air 2S propeller guards. Four protective components connect together for stability, creating a solid perimeter that shields your quadcopter\u2019s propellers from unavoidable obstacles. These DJI Mavic Air 2 and DJI Air 2S propeller guards have a quick-install mechanism for easy attachment to your device.",
        "review": "Not really necessary and somewhat bulky. I received the drone before these arrived in a separate shipment. By then I had flown the drone enough times and was more than comfortable controlling it. These guards just added too much weight and nearly doubled the overall width of the drone. Meaning it takes more thrust to takeoff, and the drone almost goes into a limp mode while drawing down the battery at a faster rate. Another flaw, the front isn\u2019t guarded, so if you did accidentally run into a tree or pole, the cameras getting smashed and the front propellers are getting shredded. The guard also doesn\u2019t extend above the props, so if you fly indoors and get close to the ceiling, again the props are getting destroyed. So I don\u2019t know, it has some uses(mostly if you\u2019re flying in a tight space), and they didn\u2019t really cost enough to bother returning them. But if I purchased it again, I would probably skip ordering the guards.",

This is my first induction range and I have to say I am very impressed with how fast it heats. The Air Fry is a game changer -previously we bought a countertop air fryer but it wasn't big enough for family sized functions, but now with an oven sized air fryer, we can accommodate a much bigger appetite. Not only does the oven work to perfection but it also looks very classy. I also really enjoy how bright the screen appears. I highly recommend this oven and I am so thankful that I can try all new recipes with Air Fry as well.",

        "review": "Mario does it again with #8. Coming from the Nintendo Wii's Mario Kart 7, the game is graphically stunning, and there are a variety of new, exciting, and gorgeous tracks with plenty of shortcuts. There are some classic tracks as well as newer ones. There are many options to customize your vehicle (e.g., parachute, wheels). Vehicle customization affects the acceleration, weight, handling, traction, and speed of the vehicle. All of the characters come unlocked, but you can unlock vehicles, parachutes, and wheels by collecting coins throughout the game. Interestingly, there is 200cc, which speeds up the track, so breaking technique is involved.\n\nGameplay: I immediately noticed that MK8D requires a lot of drifting, which is different from MK7 Wii, where drifting is optional. I found it to be more easy to get bumped off the track by heavier players. Unfortunately, some of the boost items (the golden mushroom and star) give you less speed than they used to. The benefit to the star in MK8D is its invincibility, which is a great advantage considering that players can hold up to two items. The green turtles are much more likely to hit you, are much faster, and can bounce off walls. Getting a coin in first place is often frustrating as it is not a defensive item; however, collecting coins increase your speed.\nGreat game again from Nintendo.",

From the online reviews and personal experience, this is the most silent, coolest running card on the market. Even under extremely heavy load gaming @4K, with 120+ FPS, this card never holds temps between 65\u00b0 - 72\u00b0. The factory overclock is more than enough to handle anything, with 24GB of VRAM, you will not need to upgrade this card for years! I highly recommend this card to anyone looking for an RTX3090. This is not my first ASUS product, and from what I have seen in my experience, ASUS makes superior products.",

Personalize what you get notified for and create custom activity zones to ensure you only get alerts for what matters, reducing those that are less important.

Renewal of an Arlo Secure subscription is required to maintain Arlo Secure features, including cloud storage and activity zones.",

The trial subscription is also nice and very convenient too, but you don\u2019t have to continue with it if you choose not to. You will however need to purchase a smart hub. Even then they are always are trying to persuade you to go back to the paid subscription. Battery life is decent with or without the subscription.  Cameras also need to be connected to either a solar charger or direct power if you cancel out the subscription, in order to use the activity zones feature to filter out or in certain areas of the cameras view.

        "review": "Great camera! Especially when switching from DSLR. I\u2019m coming from a shooting with the Nikon D800 for about 7 years now and i\u2019ve had a lot of trouble switching over to mirrorless. I\u2019ve tried out Sony and Cannon even the Z6ii but those files didn\u2019t satisfy my taste. I picked up this camera thinking \u201ceh I\u2019m probably not gonna like this one either\u2026it\u2019s the cheapest full frame camera in Nikon\u2019s lineup\u2026I need the *pro* cameras which are $3000 +\u201d to my surprise this camera is everything I wanted. It\u2019s has all the pros of a Nikon plus the advantages of mirrorless such as eye af, it\u2019s much lighter, touchscreen af, and more",

        "review": "Buy if you are <6ft tall. I am 6ft 2 in tall and this chair is too short for me, at my height I am constantly fighting the lumbar support feature. My wife who is shorter finds it ok. I kept it because she is the one who will be using it, yet me added a small metal cable tie to lock the lumbar support and seems to be better now. The manufacturer could add a simple screw and threaded hole at the back to give the user some flexibility to lock rather than using the lock on bottom that it currently has which doesn\u2019t lock it, just adds more tension to a spring.",
